# Breed-model
Design and training of a breeding prediction model for dogs using deep learning.

Model design and notebook in cooperation with Abdeljabbar Rachid in a project for my bachelor's degree in statistic modeling.

This project (notebook and pdf) was designed for our studies but the app.py is an initiative to present my abilities to put to production a model.

## Description
This model aims to determine breed of a dog from a picture of it. It has been trained for 5 breeds (Cairn, Chihuahua, Dingo, Great Pyrenees, Samoyed).
